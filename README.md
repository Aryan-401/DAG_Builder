# Airflow DAG Builder Agent

An intelligent agent that helps users create and manage data orchestration workflows in Apache Airflow using natural language processing and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## Overview

The Airflow DAG Builder Agent is an AI-powered tool that simplifies the process of creating and managing data pipelines in Apache Airflow. It uses natural language processing to understand user requirements and generates appropriate DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) for data orchestration tasks.

## Features

### Natural Language Interface
- Conversational interface for describing data pipeline requirements
- Understanding of data source locations, formats, and destinations
- Support for complex data transformation requirements
- Validation of pipeline logic and dependencies

### Intelligent DAG Generation
- Automatic conversion of natural language requirements to Airflow DAGs
- Best practices implementation for Airflow workflows
- Error handling and retry logic generation
- Support for various data connectors and operators

### Isolated Development Environment
- Docker-based development environment
- Pre-configured with all necessary dependencies
- Isolated testing environment for each DAG
- Version control integration

### Code Quality and Testing
- Automated code validation
- Unit test generation
- Integration test support
- Performance optimization suggestions

## How It Works

1. **Requirement Analysis**
   - User describes data pipeline requirements in natural language
   - Agent analyzes requirements using RAG to understand context
   - System identifies data sources, transformations, and destinations

2. **DAG Planning**
   - Creates a logical workflow structure
   - Identifies necessary Airflow operators
   - Plans error handling and monitoring
   - Generates dependency graph

3. **Code Generation**
   - Converts planned workflow to Airflow DAG code
   - Implements best practices and error handling
   - Generates necessary configuration files
   - Creates documentation and comments

4. **Testing and Validation**
   - Runs code in isolated Docker container
   - Performs unit tests
   - Validates data flow
   - Checks for potential issues

5. **Deployment**
   - Generates deployment configuration
   - Provides deployment instructions
   - Sets up monitoring and logging

## Technical Architecture

### Components
- RAG Engine: Processes natural language and generates code
- Code Generator: Converts RAG output to Airflow DAGs
- Docker Manager: Manages isolated development environments
- Testing Framework: Validates generated code
- Deployment Manager: Handles DAG deployment

### Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- Apache Airflow
- Docker
- Required Python packages (listed in requirements.txt)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Set up Docker environment
4. Configure your data sources
5. Start the agent

## Usage Example

```python
# Example of natural language input
"Create a DAG that reads CSV files from S3, transforms the data, and loads it into PostgreSQL"

# The agent will generate appropriate Airflow DAG code
```

## Future Enhancements

- Support for more data sources and destinations
- Advanced error handling and recovery
- Performance optimization recommendations
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Custom operator generation
- Real-time monitoring and alerting
